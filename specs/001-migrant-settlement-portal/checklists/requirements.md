# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrant Settlement Portal (MVP)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-09  
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Interpreted “languages” in the checklist as programming languages; the spec’s language requirement refers to user-facing spoken languages.
- Clarification applied: The checklist is generalized (not area-specific), and location variance is communicated as needed in the content.
- Latest scope reduction: No checklist progress tracking; MVP is landing + checklist view, with optional sign up / login.
- Best-guess defaults applied (no further clarifications needed): MVP excludes About/Contact and issue reporting; focus is landing + documents checklist + optional authentication + language switch.
